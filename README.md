### Lab 1. Linear Perceptron for Binary Classification
* Perform binary classification on the iris dataset with two classes using linear perceptron.
* Use different training/testing sized to see the effectiveness of algorithm.
* Use pocket algorithm to get optimum weights.


### Lab 2. Non Linear Transforms in Binary Classification
* Perform binary classification on wine quality dataset
* Use Non-Linear combination of degree two and compare results.


### Lab 3. Linear Regression using Perceptron
* Perform linear regression for quality of wine on wine quality dataset.
* Check error for different training and testing sizes.
* Use weights of regression to perform classification.


### Lab 4. Logistic Regression using Perceptron
* Perform logistic regression on wine quality dataset to predict classes.
* Check performance for different data sizes.
* Calculate hard and soft errors.
